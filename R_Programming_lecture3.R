Descriptive Analysis
#Just describe the population - like census
#Not trying to make assumptions, just showing data

Explatory Analysis
#Discover new connections
#useful for defining future studies
#Correlation does not imply causation

Inferential Analysis
#Small sample of data say something about bigger population
#Inference is commonly the goal of statistical models

Predictive Analysis
#use data on some objects to predict values for another object

Causal Analysis
#What happens to one variable when you make another variable change
#Usually randomized studies
#Causal relationships usually identified as average effects
#Causal models usually "gold standard"

Mechanistic Analysis
#Understand exact changes in variables that lead to changes in other variables
#hard to infer
#Usually modeled by set of equations (phyiscal/engineering)

######################
Data are values of qualitative or quantitative variables, belonging to a set of items.
Variables are a measurement or characteristic of an item

#Data is second most important thing
#Most important thing is the question
#Often data will limit or enable the questions
#having data can't save you if you don't have a quesiton

######################
Experimental Design
#Know and care about the analysis plan
#Have a plan for data and code sharing
figshare.com - larger data sharing

Formulate your question in advance
Statistical Inference -
  #use sample,
  #calculate descriptive statistics for the sample
  #calculate inferential stats for the population

  Age is confounder between shoe size and literacy
    What is the other variable causing the relationship

Fix a variable, stratify it, or randomize it

sensitivity - p(positive test | disease)
specificity - p(negative test | no disease)
Positive predictive value - p(disease | positive test)
negative predictive value - p(no disease | negative test)
Accuracy - p(correct outcome)

Good experiments
- have replication
- measure variability
- generalize to the problem you care about
- are transparent
Prediction is not inference
- Both can be important
Beware data dredging
